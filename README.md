## Project Title
Power BI Financial Dashboard â€“ Budgeting, Expense Allocation & Profitability Analysis.

## Project Description
This project simulates core responsibilities of an MIS Analyst by designing a financial dashboard that supports decision-making, budget allocation, and profitability analysis across a network of branches. Developed in Power BI, the model incorporates financial data workflows such as budget planning, staff expense monitoring, cost allocation, and data reconciliation.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated:
Budget Allocation & Cost Tracking:
Simulates the technical loading and monitoring of branch expenses against approved budgets.

Expense & Profitability Analysis:
Tracks performance by calculating budget variance and cost per revenue to assess branch profitability.

Data Modeling & Aggregation:
Designed a clean, relational model integrating core financial tables with proper transformation and aggregation logic.

Reconciliation & Data Accuracy:
Validated financial figures to ensure consistency across branches.

Analytical Reporting:
Built interactive dashboards and DAX measures to support informed insights and scenario-based evaluations for business units.

## Tools Used

Power BI: data visualization and DAX measures
Power Query: data cleaning and transformation
Data Modeling: relationship building for accurate KPIs

## Outcome

This dashboard enables financial managers and analysts to:
- Compare planned vs. actual expenses
- Identify financially disciplined branches
- Take corrective actions based on overspending trends
- Understand cost distribution across branches
- Support strategic financial planning and optimization
